It is with a heavy heart that I am announcing the vibeOS project is being discontinued and will go inactive indefinitely.

I intended to create more blog posts and keep this website updated, but unfortunately that did not happen, and given the nature of this post, it will likely be the last.

To further explain this decision, the following is an excerpt from an announcement I made on my Discord server:

> vibeOS: After Divide's announcement that he was moving onto a new chapter in his life, I had suspected this would mean vibeOS would not be receiving anymore updates and I believe I have been more or less correct in that. If i'm honest, Divide is not the only one who has moved onto a new chapter in his life, and really I don't have any motivation to continue work on vibeOS. I will need to talk with Divide, but my intention is to open source the next generation of vibeOS that we we're working on, and leave it there in case anyone wants to dink around with it. That will be a discussion I will have to make with Divide but what I can say for now is that vibeOS is going to be inactive indefinitely.

Beyond that, I will mention that Divide and I did make considerable progress on the announced "new" version of vibeOS that was created to replace what is now known as vibeOS Legacy. During it's development it remained closed source, however, given no more development will occur It is my intention to release it and have it archived.

I want to take a moment and thank anyone who, even slightly, contributed to this project. This has been a fun project to work on, and I learned a lot, but the show must go on.

Sincerely,
