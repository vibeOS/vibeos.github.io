Following up on my announcement in October, today the current version of vibeOS has been set to public and all repositories have been archived. Divide gave his blessing to have everything set free so it will be. 
You can find it here: [https://github.com/vibeOS/vibeos-source](https://github.com/vibeOS/vibeos-source)

As for this website, I have removed the package list as it is not representative of the current state of things. I have no intention of finishing the about.md or gettingstarted.md files, but may circle back and include compilation instructions anyway.

It's my hope that somebody finds this on a strange whim and appriciates our work, or even continues it in their own way. But alas, the history of this project will likely slip into darkness, at least archived somewhere on earth.

That is all.
