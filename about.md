**Attn 2021-11-13: vibeOS is a deprecated project and this document has not been updated to reflect the current state of the project.**

## History

Where did vibeOS Begin? It starts with a breif modern history. On July 10, 2020, Divide messaged me with a ZIP file containing one of the first
versions of what would become vibeOS Legacy. It was basic and buggy, with the only thing really working being able to move the windows around, but it showed promise. I was onboard and got to work... even though I had little to no JavaScript knowlage at that time.

In retrospect, it was pretty clear that vibeOS was a hobby project with the intent of honing our skills. While dreaming big as to what vibeOS could become might seem nieve now, it did keep us going and pushing further and further. At this point in development, Divide was mainly working on the back end of vibeOS and the apps that would run on it from the start to give us a base to work off of. In the meantime, we had been pooling thoughts on what we wanted vibeOS to do, and to excersize these ideas, I got to work on the design for vibeOS's Configuration Utility. This seemed like an appropriate starting position given its proximity to the other apps and system functions it would interact with, and would give me space to create a design language for the system applications.
